      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Automato is made in Bulgaria, and the way we handle data meets Bulgarian legal requirements.
        The software is made by Dmitrii Pechkovskii-Tsikorin.
        If any part of our Privacy Policy was unclear or if you have further questions,
        get in touch at <a href="mailto:dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com">dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com</a>.

      <h2>1. How we process your personal data</h2>
      <p>
        All data you personally enter into the software application is stored only on the device you're using it on,
        and is only used by the software application itself. Your data is never transmitted to our servers or to servers of third parties.
        We do not process personal data that directly identifies you as a person (such as your first name, surname, email, and so on).
      </p>
      <p>Here are the types of data we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Device data</b>
          This data informs us about the device you are using the software application on, such as the model, name and identifiers, device settings, the application identifier, and crash information. On our website, we collect information about your browser and browser settings, the operating system you use, and the system settings of your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Event and usage data</b>
          When you use the app or when you go to our website, our servers process data in order to understand your usage of our servicesâ€”for example, which pages you visit or which features are used in the app. We collect this information and use it as aggregate data to better understand which features are the most relevant or useful to our users as a whole.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>IP address</b>
          We collect IP addresses provided by your browser or computer to deliver the service to your device. We also use the IP address to determine your approximate location for statistical and analytics purposes.
          All the data we collect is necessary to deliver the services you use. The amount we collect has been minimized wherever possible to respect your privacy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By accepting this privacy policy and by using our app, you explicitly agree to the collection and processing of your data. Should you disagree with it, we recommend you stop using our services, or uninstall the app.
