The software is made by Dmitrii Pechkovskii-Tsikorin. If you have any questions, get in touch at <a href="mailto:dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com"><u>dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com</u></a>.<br><small>Last updated: May 1th, 2023</small></p><h2>1. How we process your personal data</h2><p>All data you personally enter into the software application is stored only on the device you&#039;re using it on, and is only used by the software application itself. Your data is never transmitted to our servers or to servers of third parties. We do not process personal data that directly identifies you as a person (such as your first name, surname, email, and so on).</p><p>Here are the types of data we collect:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Device data</strong> This data informs us about the device you are using the software application on, such as the model, name and identifiers, device settings, the application identifier, and crash information. On our website, we collect information about your browser and browser settings, the operating system you use, and the system settings of your device.</p></li><li><p><strong>Event and usage data</strong> When you use the app or when you go to our website, our servers process data in order to understand your usage of our services—for example, which pages you visit or which features are used in the app. We collect this information and use it as aggregate data to better understand which features are the most relevant or useful to our users as a whole.</p></li><li><p><strong>IP address</strong> We collect IP addresses provided by your browser or computer to deliver the service to your device. We also use the IP address to determine your approximate location for statistical and analytics purposes. All the data we collect is necessary to deliver the services you use. The amount we collect has been minimized wherever possible to respect your privacy.</p></li></ul><p>By accepting this privacy policy and by using our app, you explicitly agree to the collection and processing of your data. Should you disagree with it, we recommend you stop using our services, or uninstall the app.</p><h2>2. Your rights</h2><ul><li><p>Our products and services have been designed to minimize the use of your personal data. We only collect and process your data for the purposes that have been previously outlined.</p></li><li><p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com"><u>dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com</u></a> if you have any questions about the security of our services.</p></li><li><p>We do not retain your data in an identifiable format for longer than necessary to deliver our services.</p></li><li><p>We do not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling activities.</p></li></ul><p>As a user of our services and website, you may exercise your user rights to:</p><ul><li><p>Request information on your personal data processed by us. Upon your request, this information will be provided to you electronically.</p></li><li><p>Withdraw your consent from data processing at any time by deleting the software application from your device.</p></li><li><p>Request the complete deletion of your data, including all past data sent to third-party services used for tracking and analysis, by reaching out to support@bluebanana-software.com.

Data Security</h2><p>We apply security measures to protect against the misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal information under our control. We follow industry best practices when transferring and storing your data. Though we cannot ensure or guarantee that misuse, loss or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Protect your device:</strong> Activate either passcode or TouchID authentication for your device. This automatically encrypts your data and prevents any person from using your device without your permission.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protect your data:</strong> All of your data will be stored solely on your device and we won’t have access to it. If you delete this data or lose your device, your data in the software application will also be lost. We strongly recommend that you back up your data regularly.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Data transfer outside the EU and to third-party applications</h2><p>Any personal data collected from you may only be transferred to countries outside the European Union / the European Economic Area (EEA) observing applicable privacy regulations and ensuring that your privacy rights remain protected.</p><h2>5. Cookies and tracking</h2><p>This website does use tracking and analytics. <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"><u>Read more about the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.</u></a></p><h2>6. Young users</h2><p>The software application does not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the age of 13. If the software application gains actual knowledge that the information has been collected from children under the age of thirteen in the United States in contradiction with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the regulation thereunder, we will not disclose this data and reserves the right to immediately wipe all related information, including sensitive data of the user, from our servers. If you are located in the EU, you can only use our services if you are over the relevant age at which you can provide explicit consent to the processing of your data under the laws of your country or if you have the consent of your parent or legal guardian.

Please check this page periodically for changes. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you by posting notice of these changes in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>If any part of our Privacy Policy was unclear or if you have further questions, get in touch at <a href="mailto:dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com"><u>dmitrii.pechkovskii.tsikorin@gmail.com</u></a>.</p>
